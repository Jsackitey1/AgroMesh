# 🌱 EcoMesh: A Community-Powered Smart Environmental Monitoring Network

EcoMesh is a decentralized, solar-powered network of open-source environmental sensors designed to monitor **air quality**, **water purity**, and **soil health** in underserved communities. The data is visualized in real time and enhanced by AI to detect anomalies, generate alerts, and support environmental decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Empower communities with real-time environmental data.
- Build an affordable and replicable sensing platform.
- Use AI to identify trends, forecast pollution, and issue smart alerts.
- Enable open collaboration and citizen science around the world.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🌬️ Air Quality (CO₂, PM2.5)
- 💧 Water Quality (pH, turbidity)
- 🌱 Soil Monitoring (moisture, pH)
- ☀️ Solar-powered, low-power nodes
- 📶 LoRaWAN or WiFi connectivity
- 📊 Live dashboards + SMS/email alerts
- 🤖 AI-powered anomaly detection + prediction
- 🌍 Community-led deployment and data ownership

## 🧠 AI Functionality

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects sudden spikes or unusual readings using Isolation Forests and Autoencoders.
- **Forecasting**: Uses historical environmental data + weather to predict future trends.
- **Adaptive Sampling** *(coming soon)*: Adjusts data collection rate based on sensor variability using reinforcement learning.

## 📈 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE / Python 3.10+
- Firebase account (for cloud data)
- ESP8266 / Arduino board + sensors

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoMesh.git

# Navigate to backend and install dependencies
cd EcoMesh/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local API server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

🧪 Sample Use Case
A school in Ghana deploys a node near a river. The system detects a pH drop and sends an alert via SMS. Students visualize the event on a real-time dashboard and investigate pollution sources, contributing to local environmental education and health safety.
