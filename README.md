# 🌾 AgroMesh: A Community-Powered Smart Agricultural Monitoring Network

**AgroMesh** is a decentralized, solar-powered network of open-source environmental sensors designed to help **farmers** in  underserved regions optimize **crop yield**, **resource usage**, and **resilience to climate variability**. It monitors **soil conditions**, **weather patterns**, and **microclimates** in real time—and uses AI to generate smart irrigation alerts, pest risk warnings, and harvest forecasts.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Empower smallholder farmers with real-time, actionable environmental data.
- Build a low-cost, replicable precision agriculture platform.
- Use AI to forecast irrigation needs, detect crop stress, and improve yield.
- Encourage open collaboration between engineers, farmers, and educators.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🌱 Soil Health Monitoring (moisture, pH, nutrients)
- 🌦️ Weather Tracking (temperature, humidity, rainfall)
- ☀️ Solar-powered, low-maintenance sensor nodes
- 📶 LoRaWAN or WiFi data transmission
- 📊 Live dashboards + SMS alerts in local languages
- 🤖 AI-powered irrigation and pest risk predictions
- 🧑‍🌾 Farmer-centered deployment and co-design

## 🧠 AI Functionality

- **Irrigation Forecasting**: Suggests optimal watering schedules using weather + soil data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal moisture drops or potential sensor faults.
- **Pest & Disease Risk Prediction**: Detects conditions that typically precede fungal outbreaks or pest invasions.
- **Yield Estimation** *(coming soon)*: Forecasts crop output based on seasonal data patterns.

## 📈 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE / Python 3.10+
- Firebase account (for cloud data)
- ESP8266 / Arduino board + soil/weather sensors

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgroMesh.git

# Navigate to backend and install dependencies
cd AgroMesh/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local API server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

🧪 Sample Use Case

A cassava farmer in Northern Ghana installs a solar-powered sensor node in their field. AgroMesh sends an SMS advising early morning irrigation due to falling soil moisture and rising heat. A week later, the system flags a potential fungal risk window based on humidity levels. The farmer avoids crop stress, uses less water, and boosts yield by 20%.
