# Security Checklist

## API Key Security Status

### Google Gemini API Key Protection
- ✅ **Stored in Environment Variables**: API key is stored securely in environment variables
- ✅ **Not in Source Code**: API key is NOT hardcoded in any source files
- ✅ **Not in Git Repository**: API key is NOT committed to version control
- ✅ **Environment-based Access**: Only accessible through `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- ✅ **Production Environment**: Configured in production environment

### MongoDB Connection Security
- ✅ **Stored in Environment Variables**: Connection string is stored securely
- ✅ **URL Encoded Password**: Special characters properly encoded
- ✅ **Not in Source Code**: Connection string is NOT hardcoded
- ✅ **Not in Git Repository**: Connection string is NOT committed to version control

### JWT Security
- ✅ **Secure JWT Secret**: Strong random JWT secret configured
- ✅ **Environment Variable**: JWT secret stored in environment variables
- ✅ **Not Exposed**: JWT secret is NOT in source code or logs

### Environment Variables
Current secure configuration:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=[PROTECTED]
MONGODB_URI=[PROTECTED]
GEMINI_API_KEY=[PROTECTED]
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Security
- All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- Environment variables are encrypted at rest
- No sensitive data in application code
- Proper error handling to prevent exposure

### 2. Database Security
- MongoDB Atlas with authentication enabled
- Connection over encrypted TLS/SSL
- Network access configured appropriately
- Database user with read/write permissions only

### 3. API Security
- JWT-based authentication implemented
- CORS properly configured for applications
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting configured

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- Managed environment deployment
- Automatic security updates
- Load balancer with health checks
- Instance isolation

## Security Verification Tests

### API Key Functionality Test
✅ **Gemini AI Test Passed**: AI endpoints responding correctly

### Database Connection Test
✅ **MongoDB Test Passed**: User registration/login working

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ API key added to environment variables
2. ✅ MongoDB connection secured with URL encoding
3. ✅ JWT secret configured
4. ✅ All sensitive data removed from source code

### Future Security Enhancements
1. **API Key Rotation**: Set up quarterly rotation of API keys
2. **Enhanced JWT Secret**: Consider using a longer, more complex JWT secret
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual API usage
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled for production

## Security Incident Response

### If API Key is Compromised
1. Immediately revoke the current Gemini API key in Google Cloud Console
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update environment variables with new key
4. Monitor usage for unusual API usage

### If Database is Compromised
1. Change MongoDB Atlas password immediately
2. Update connection string in environment variables
3. Review database access logs
4. Rotate JWT secret

## Security Status: SECURE
